# OffsetSplineY
Simple Cinema 4D Python Spline Generator Object

Shows how to create an object that uses other spline objects as inputs.

This started as a [question on the PluginCafe forums](http://www.plugincafe.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=13170).
 Riccardo of Maxon's SDK Support team generated [this example](http://pastebin.com/LHsjdg8f) It's still something
  of a work in progress. [Known issues](https://github.com/donovankeith/OffsetSplineY/issues). Please add suggestions and edits to improve the functionality. It would be great if this could become *the* starting point for future similar development.
